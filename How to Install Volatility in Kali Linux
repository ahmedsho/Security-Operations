# Create a virtual environment for the Installation:

source ./environment_volatility/bin/activate

# Install pycryptodome as part of the requirements:
pip3 install pycryptodome

# Enabling SFTP:
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl status ssh
(I obtained Snapshot of VM images & I used WinSCP to transfer the snapshot to Kali Linux)
